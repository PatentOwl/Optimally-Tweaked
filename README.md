Q and A

Q: Why is fastload not installed?

A: Fastload doesnt let you controll your chatacter when joining world(At least on my PC)

Q: Why are there no Icons/Title change on my Minecraft?

A: Activate the ressource packs in minecraft. Keep in mind that the order of activation might lead to visual bugs.

Q: Why does my PC perform worse with these mods than without?

A: A mod like Sodium uses modern Rendering Techniques. Your computer might not support these. Try removing it and mods dependend on it.
